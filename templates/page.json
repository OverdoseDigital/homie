At least 12 times a year, HoMie closes our shop to the public and invites young people connected to community support services to come in and shop for free. Each VIP can select five items of brand-new HoMie clothing, receive haircuts, beauty services, and personal care packs, all while enjoying lunch with the HoMie team.<br\/> <br\/>At least once a year, we try to take the VIP Days on the road – heading out to a rural or remote part of the country and connecting with the young people there.<br\/> <br\/>For young people who can’t attend a VIP Day in person, we offer personalised VIP Packs, which includes five items of brand new HoMie clothing chosen personally for them.<br\/><br\/>We developed the VIP Program to provide young people affected by homelessness or hardship with a day of confidence and connection - a day where they can feel like the VIP they are. <\/p>"
